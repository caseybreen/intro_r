## Intro to `R` -- Session 2

```{r}
library(here)
library(tidyverse)

censoc <- read_csv(here("data/censoc_numident_demo_v2.1.csv"))
```

-   Reminder: course materials available from:

    -   [www.github.com/caseybreen/intro_r](www.github.com/caseybreen/intro_r)

-   Questions on problem set 1?

## Review of session 1

-   What's the difference between `R` and `RStudio`?
-   What's a `vector`? What's a `data.frame`?
-   What does the `$` operator do? What does `data$column_b` do?
-   What are two different data structures? What are three different data types?
-   What does `%in%` operator do?
-   What does the `!` operator do?

## Session 2

-   **Module 4**: Importing and exporting in data

-   **Module 5**: Data manipulation (`dplyr`) and data visualization (`ggplot2`)

-   **Module 6**: Best practices for `R` coding and resources for self-study

# Module 4

## Importing and exporting data

Learning objectives

-   Common data formats

-   Functions for importing / exporting data

-   Types of file paths in `R`

## Importing data {.smaller}

-   Common formats for data

    -   .csv, .xlsx, .txt, .dat (stata), etc.

-   Key functions

    -   `read_csv()` function from `tidyverse`: Read CSV files

        -   Also built-in ("base") function: `read.csv()`

    -   `read.table()`: Read text files

    -   `readxl::read_excel()`: Read Excel files

```{r}
#| eval: false 
#| echo: true 
## read in CSV file 
df <- read_csv("/path/to/your/data.csv") ## faster

## read in stata file 
library(haven)
data <- read_dta("path/to/file.dta")
```

## File paths

-   **Absolute Path**: Specifies the full path locate a file or directory, starting with the root directory.

    -   Windows: `"C:\Users\username\folder\file.csv"`

    -   macOS/Linux: `"/home/username/folder/file.csv"`

-   **Relative Path**: Specifies how to find the file or directory based on the current working directory.

    -   `folder/file.csv`

## Working directories {.smaller}

-   The working directory is the folder where your R session or script looks for files to read, or where it saves files you write

-   Commands like **`read_csv("file.csv")`** or **`write_csv(data, "file.csv")`** will read from or write to this directory by default

-   Key syntax:

    -   **`getwd()`** --- returns working directory

    -   **`setwd("/path/to/folder")`** --- sets working directory

```{r}
#| echo: true
getwd()
```

## Reading in .CSV files

-   Recap: to read in .csv files use `read_csv()` function from `tidyverse`

    -   This will read in the .csv file into memory as a `data frame`

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

library(tidyverse)
df <- read_csv("dataset.csv")
```

-   Write out a `data frame` to a .csv file using `write_csv()`:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
write_csv(df, "dataset_v2.csv") 
```

## Downloading data for exercises

-   We will be using the CenSoc Numident Demo dataset

-   Please download the .csv file from the course website (`intro_r/data`)

-   Short url: <https://shorturl.at/egz69>

## Live coding demo

-   Downloading demo file from Github
-   Reading in a .csv file in `R` using `read_csv()`

## Data manipulation and visualization

Learning objectives

-   Overview of `tidyverse` suite of packages

-   Fundamentals of data manipulation with `dplyr`

-   Data visualization with `ggplot`

## Tidyverse

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Packages: Collection of R packages designed for data science.
-   Data manipulation: Simplifies data cleaning and transformation with `dplyr`.
-   Data Visualization: Enables advanced plotting with `ggplot2`.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.height=10}
knitr::include_graphics(here("slides/session2_slides_files/figs/tidyverse_fig.png"))
```
:::
:::::

## Data Manipulation using `dplyr` {.smaller}

`filter`: Select rows based on conditions.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

filtered_df <- filter(df, age > 21)
```

`select`: Choose specific columns

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

filtered_df <- select(df)
```

`mutate`: Add or modify columns

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

df <- mutate(df, age_next_year = age + 1)
```

`summarize` or `summarise`: Aggregate or summarize data based on some criteria

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

filtered_df <- summarize(df, mean(age))
```

`group_by`: Group data by variables. Often used with `summarise()`.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
filtered_df <- df %>% 
  group_by(gender) %>% 
  summarize(mean(age))
```

## The Pipe Operator `%>%` (or `|>` ) in R

-   Takes the output of one function and passes it as the first argument to another function

    -   "And then do..."

-   What's the below code doing?

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
filtered_df <- df %>% 
  group_by(gender) %>% 
  summarize(mean(age))
```

# Recoding values in R

-   Sometime you want to recode a variable to take different values (e.g., recoding exact income to binary high/low income variable)

-   The `case_when()` function in `R` is part of the `dplyr` package and is used for creating new variables based on multiple conditions:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false 
new_var <- case_when(
  condition1 ~ value1,
  condition2 ~ value2,
  TRUE ~ value_otherwise
)
```

## Live coding demo

-   Filter data

-   Selecting data

-   Calculating summary statistics by group

-   Creating and recoding variables

## In-class exercise 2

1.  Filter the `censoc` data.frame to include only women (`sex == 2`). Use the `filter` command.
2.  Filter the `censoc` data.frame to include only people born between 1905 and 1920 using the `byear` variable.
3.  Select the columns `histid`, `death_age`, `sex`, and `ownershp`
4.  Calculate the average age of death for women (hint: refer to question 1)

## Exercise 2 solutions {.smaller}

1.  Filter the `censoc` data.frame to include only women (sex == 2). Use the `filter` command.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
## filter to only include women 
censoc %>% 
  filter(sex == 2)

```

2.  Filter the `censoc` data.frame to include only people born between 1905 and 1920 using the `byear` variable.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

## method 1 
censoc %>% 
  filter(byear %in% 1905:1920)

## method 2 
censoc %>% 
  filter(byear >= 1905 & byear <= 1920)
```

## Exercise 2 solutions (cont.) {.smaller}

3.  Select the columns `histid`, `death_age`, `sex`, and `ownershp`

```{r}
#| echo: true
censoc_select <- censoc %>% 
  select(histid, death_age, sex, ownershp) 

head(censoc_select)
```

4.  Calculate the average age of death for women (hint: refer to question 1)

```{r}
#| echo: true
censoc %>% 
  filter(sex == 2) %>% 
  summarize(mean_death_age_women = mean(death_age))
```

## Data visualization using ggplot

-   `ggplot2` provides a powerful and flexible system for creating a variety of data visualizations

-   `data`: specifies the dataset to be used for the plot

-   `aes`: Defines what data to show

-   `geoms`: Chooses the type of plot (e.g., histogram)

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

ggplot(data = <DATA>) + 
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>))
```

## Types of plots

-   `geom_point()`: Scatter plot
-   `geom_bar()`: Bar chart
-   `geom_histogram()`: Histogram

## Basic histogram example

-   Histogram of age of death in censoc dataset

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| 
ggplot(data = censoc) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(x = death_age)) 
```

## Customisable -- specify theme

-   `+ theme(<theme_choice>)` will add on a theme

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| 
ggplot(data = censoc) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(x = death_age)) + 
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15)
```

## Customisable -- specify colors

-   `color` and `fill` will can change color / fill of plot

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| 
ggplot(data = censoc) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(x = death_age), color = "black", fill = "grey") + 
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15)
```

## Customisable -- add on labels/title

-   `+ labs()` add on title/axis labels

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| 
ggplot(data = censoc) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(x = death_age), color = "black", fill = "grey") + 
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15) + 
  labs(title = "Distribution of age of death", x = "Age of Death (yrs)")
```

## Live coding demo

-   Create histogram using `ggplot`

-   Demonstrate flexibility of `ggplot`

    -   Themes
    -   Axis labels, titles
    -   Colors

## Best practices and resources for self-study

Learning objectives

-   Best practices for writing and documenting code

-   Where to go when you're stuck

-   Resources for learning more

## Best practices (opinionated)

-   **Style**: use descriptive names and "snake_case"
-   **Documentation**: Start commenting your code early, it's a good habit for the future
-   **Learn `tidyverse`**: offers a more coherent syntax and is widely used in data science
-   **Advanced topics**: R Projects, github integration, etc

## When you're stuck

-   Google

    -   Lots of packages have documentation available online

    -   Stack overflow -- excellent resource

-   Use help syntax (e.g., `?dplyr`)

-   GPT4 (decent, but be careful!)

## Resources for learning more

1.  R for data science (<https://r4ds.hadley.nz/>)
2.  Data visualization: a practical introduction (<https://socviz.co/>)

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=4}
knitr::include_graphics(here("slides/session2_slides_files/figs/r_for_datascience.png"))
```

## In-class exercise 4 {.smaller}

Do homeowners in the United States live longer than renters in the United States?

1.  Using the `censoc` data.frame, create a new data.frame `censoc_homeownership` that filters out any "missing" value for the `ownershp` variable (missing = 0). Use the `filter()` command.

2.  In the `censoc_homeownership` data.frame, create a new variable `homeowner` using the `mutate()` command and the `case_when()` command. Assign this new variable `homeowner` a value of "own" if `ownershp == 1` and a value of "rent" if `ownershp == 2`.

3.  Make a histogram on the age of death for "homeowner" and "renter" groups using `ggplot` using the `censoc_homeownership` data.frame. Use the `+ facet_wrap(~homeowner)` command.

4.  Calculate the average age of death for "homeowner" and "renter" groups. Which group lives longer, on average? Use the `group_by()` and `summarize()` functions. What are some possible explanations for homeowners living longer than renters in the US?

## Exercise 4 solution {.smaller}

Do homeowners in the United States live longer than renters in the United States?
