# Problem Set 1

Complete the following questions in R within a Quarto document.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Exercise 1: Assignment, Arithmetic, Logical Expressions

### 1a

Assign `x` and `y` to take values 3 and 4.

### 1b

Create a new variable `z` as the product of `x` and `y`.

### 1c

Calculate the square of 3 and assign it to a variable called `three_squared`.

### 1d

Write a logical expression to check if `three_squared` is greater than 10. Discuss scenarios where such a filter could be useful.

### 1e

Write a logical expression to test whether `three_squared` is not greater than 10. Use the negate ( `!`) operator.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Exercise 2: Sequencing

### 2a

Generate vectors containing the numbers 100 to 105 using three different methods (`c()`, `seq()`, `:`). Discuss the convenience of each method.

### 2b

Generate a sequence of all even numbers between 0 and 100.

### 2c

Create a descending sequence from 100 to 1 and assign it to a variable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Exercise 3: Data Generation and Basic Statistical Analysis

### 3a

Generate a sample of 100 observations from a normal distribution with a mean of 10 and a standard deviation of 2. Use the `rnorm()` function.

### 3b

Calculate the mean of this generated sample. Relate this to the population mean.

### 3c

Calculate the difference between the sample mean and the population mean. Discuss the reason for the discrepancy.

### 3d

Repeat steps 1--3 with a sample size of 10,000. Discuss whether the difference between the sample and population mean decreased and its implications.
