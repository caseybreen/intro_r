# Problem Set 2

Complete the following questions in R within a Quarto document.

## Exercise 1: Work with Real-World Data

For this exercise, download the CenSoc-Numident Demo file (as .CSV) and the accompanying codebook (as PDF) from [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/QVDPM9). The CenSoc-Numident is an individual-level data with information on individual-level mortality and sociodemographic characteristics.

### 1.1

Read in the dataset using `read_csv()` from the tidyverse package.

### 1.2

How many columns are in the dataset?

### 1.3

How many rows are in the dataset?

### 1.4

List the column names. What are a few research questions that could be addressed using this dataset.

## Exercise 1: Data manipulation

### 2.1

Filter the `censoc` data frame to include only women (sex == 2). Use the `filter` command.

### 2.2

Filter the dataset to only include people born between 1905 and 1920 using the `byear` variable.

### 2.3

Select the columns `histid`, `death_age`, `sex`, and `ownershp`

### 2.4

Calculate the average age of death for women (hint: refer to question 1)

## Exercise 3 - Data visualization

### 3.1

Make a histogram of the variable `death_age`. When are most people dying?

### 3.2

Make a histogram of the variable `byear`. When are most people born?

### 3.3

Recode the variable `sex` from numeric (1, 2) to take values "men" and "women"

### 3.4

Calculate the mean of of death for both men and women using `group_by()` and `summarize()`. Do men or women live longer?

### 3.5

Make a histogram of the variable `death_age` for both men and women. Use the `filter()` command.

### 3.6

Now try adding the following line to the histogram you made in question 1: `+ facet_wrap(~sex)`

## Exercise 4 - mortality advantage of homeowners

Do homeowners in the United States live longer than renters in the United States?

### 4.1

Using the `censoc` data.frame, create a new data.frame `censoc_homeownership` that filters out any "not available values" for the `ownershp` variable (values of ownershp = 0). Use the `filter` command.

### 4.2

In the `censoc_homeownership` data.frame, create a new variable `homeowner` using the `mutate` command and the `case_when` command. Assign this new variable `homeowner` a value of "own" if `ownershp == 1` and a value of "rent" if `ownershp == 2`. Note: we can check the values for this variable here: <https://usa.ipums.org/usa-action/variables/OWNERSHP#codes_section>

### 4.3

Make a histogram on the age of death for "homeowner" and "renter" groups using `ggplot.` Use the `facet_wrap(~homeowner)` --- and make sure you're using your `censoc_homeownership` data.frame

### 4.4 

Calculate the average age of death for "homeowner" and "renter" groups. Which group lives longer, on average? Use the `group_by` and `summarize` commands. What are some possible explanations for homeowners living longer than renters in the US?
