# Problem Set 2

Complete the following questions in R within a Quarto document.


## Exercise 1: Work with Real-World Data

For this exercise, download the CenSoc-Numident Demo file (as .CSV) and the accompanying codebook (as PDF) from [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/QVDPM9). The CenSoc-Numident is an individual-level data with information on individual-level mortality and sociodemographic characteristics.

### 1a

Read in the dataset using `read_csv()` from the tidyverse package.

### 1b

How many columns are in the dataset?

### 1c

How many rows are in the dataset?

### 1d

List the column names. What are a few research questions that could be addressed using this dataset.

## Exercise 1: Data manipulation 

### 2a 

Filter the `censoc` data frame to include only women (sex == 2). Use the `filter` command.

### 2b

Filter the dataset to only include people born between 1905 and 1920 using the `byear` variable.

### 2c

Select the columns `histid`, `death_age`, `sex`, and `ownershp`

### 2d

Calculate the average age of death for women (hint: refer to question 1)


## Exercise 3 - Data visualization 


### 3a 

Make a histogram of the variable `death_age`. When are most people dying?

### 3b 

Make a histogram of the variable `byear`. When are most people born?

### 3c 

Recode the variable `sex` from numeric (1, 2) to take values "men" and "women"

### 3d 

Calculate the mean of of death for both men and women using `group_by()` and `summarize()`. Do men or women live longer?

### 3e

Make a histogram of the variable `death_age` for both men and women. Use the `filter()` command.

### 3f 

Now try adding the following line to the histogram you made in question 1: `+ facet_wrap(~sex)`

## Exercise 4 - mortality advantage of homeowners 

Do homeowners in the United States live longer than renters in the United States?

## 4a 

Google "IPUMS ownershp variable" and look at what each numerical value means. Recode `ownershp` to create a character variable `homeowner` that takes value "homeowner" or "renter". Filter out cases where we don't know whether someone was a homeowner or not.

## 4b 

Make a histogram on the age of death for "homeowner" and "renter" groups using `ggplot`

## 4c 

Calculate the average age of death for "homeowner" and "renter" groups. Which group lives longer, on average? Does this analysis tell us anything about homeownership and longevity?
